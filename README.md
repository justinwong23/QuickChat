QuickChat

A Chat Application built using Socket.io

QuickChat is a chat application that allows users to communicate with one another in real-time using TCP sockets. It features a user login and registration system that provides form validation and password encryption, and it allows users to change their passwords at any time. Users can also connect with other registered users, add or delete them from their contact lists, and see if they are currently logged in and active. A user's total number of unread messages is always displayed at the top of the interface, and clicking this area reveals their unread messages grouped by sender. All messages are saved to a database and are retrieved when users log in to their accounts. The application will also notify users the moment a message is received.

This application was built using a modified MERN stack: the frontend was built using React, the backend using Node.js and Express, and the database using MySQL. Additionally, Socket.IO was used to manage the transmission and reception of real-time events.
